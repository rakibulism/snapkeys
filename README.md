# SnapKeys ⌨️

An Android keyboard that turns short **typo shortcuts** into full text — universally, in any app.

Type `brb` + space and it becomes `be right back`. Type `@@` and it becomes your email. Because SnapKeys is a system-wide keyboard (an Android *Input Method*), the expansions work everywhere — messaging apps, browsers, notes, forms — not just inside one app.

> Status: early scaffold. The core expansion engine, storage, keyboard service, and management UI are in place. The on-screen key layout is intentionally minimal and meant to be extended.

### 📲 Download & install

**[⬇ Download snapkeys.apk](https://github.com/rakibulism/snapkeys/releases/download/latest/snapkeys.apk)** — always the newest build from `main`, no login needed.

1. Open the link above on your phone and download the APK.
2. Tap the downloaded file. Allow "install unknown apps" if Android asks.
3. If Play Protect warns you, tap **More details → Install anyway** (expected for apps outside the Play Store).

## How it works

- **`ime/SnapKeysService`** — an `InputMethodService` registered with the system. When enabled and selected, it becomes the active keyboard across the whole device.
- **`ime/ExpansionEngine`** — pure, unit-tested logic. It watches the word before the cursor and, when a delimiter (space, newline, punctuation) is typed, replaces a matching trigger with its expansion.
- **`ime/KeyboardView`** — a simple QWERTY key grid built in code that emits key events to the service.
- **`data/Shortcut` + `data/ShortcutStore`** — the shortcut model and JSON-backed persistence (SharedPreferences).
- **`ui/MainActivity` + `ui/EditShortcutActivity`** — manage (add / edit / delete) your shortcuts.

## Using it on a device

1. Build & install the app (see below).
2. Open **SnapKeys** and tap **Enable SnapKeys keyboard** — this opens
   *Settings → System → Languages & input → On-screen keyboard*. Toggle SnapKeys on.
3. In any text field, tap the keyboard-switch button and choose **SnapKeys Keyboard**.
4. Add shortcuts in the app. They apply instantly, everywhere.

Ships with a few defaults (`brb`, `omw`, `ty`, `@@`) so you can try it immediately.

## Build

```bash
# Requires the Android SDK. From the project root:
./gradlew assembleDebug        # build the APK
./gradlew test                 # run the ExpansionEngine unit tests
./gradlew installDebug         # install onto a connected device/emulator
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Symbols / numbers page and long-press alternates on the keyboard
- [ ] Case-preserving expansions (e.g. `Brb` → `Be right back`)
- [ ] Import / export shortcuts
- [ ] Per-shortcut enable toggle in the UI
- [ ] Themes (light/dark, key styling)
- [ ] Suggestion bar / inline autocomplete
